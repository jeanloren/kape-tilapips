            <h3>Lyle Joyce M. Saturinas</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Achieving academic excellence is no easy task, let alone graduating Summa Cum Laude at a prestigious
                    institution such as the University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP), where the educational culture
                    and
                    environment are exceptionally challenging and demanding. However, a trailblazer has broken a
                    decades-long drought of this distinguished honor, marking a significant milestone in the
                    university's
                    history.

                    Even with the odds stacked against her, Lyle Joyce M. Saturinas from the College of Business
                    Administration, particularly in the Bachelor of Science in Accountancy program, has further pushed
                    the
                    university’s academic envelope, finishing as the Class of 2024 Batch Valedictorian with a General
                    Weighted Average (GWA) of 1.18, Summa Cum Laude.

                    A far cry from being smooth-sailing, her path was paved with big risks as she entered the university
                    in
                    a once fresh, newly-established BS Accountancy program—a program that, in recent memory, has gained
                    notoriety for its strict retention policy and a striking reputation of having sky-high standards.

                    Her journey also had a rocky start, with her formative years in the institution being held online
                    due to
                    the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic, to which she deems to have taken a toll on everyone
                    physically,
                    mentally, and spiritually.

                    “On some days, I think [that] my stay at the University is quite short because of the pandemic. But
                    looking back, it felt quite long also,” she recalled.

                    Reflecting on her experiences and trials that she has encountered throughout her stay in the
                    pioneering
                    batch of the program, her third year stood out the most. It was during that time when the sheer
                    difficulty of the program really sunk in as her workload was filled to the brim with major subjects.

                    In her valedictory address, Lyle recounts moments where the thought of “Please, Lord, bisan dos
                    lang,”
                    crosses her mind, not out of settling for mediocrity, but to survive within the program knowing its
                    high
                    mortality rate.

                    “The days then felt long as I woke up early in the morning to study and ended the night from hours
                    of
                    studying as well after spending the whole day attending classes in school,” she revealed the
                    sacrifices
                    that she made.

                    But she persevered, carrying with her the values fundamental to her character which are
                    self-discipline,
                    setting priorities, hard work, and perseverance. Beyond those values; however, she holds one life
                    event
                    as a core source of her strength—her father’s passing.

                    “When I am faced [with an] overwhelming load of academic requirements […] one thing crosses my mind,
                    and
                    it says: Wala ra ni. Wala nay mas lisod pa sa pagkawala sa akong Papa,” she says, affirming to
                    herself
                    that if she was strong enough to overcome that moment in the past, she can conquer anything.

                    She also found inspiration in their program head, Dr. Enrico C. Yee, Jr., whose guidance helped her
                    class strive for self-improvement. She shared his words that resonated with her most: “Develop speed
                    and
                    accuracy; suffer now [studying], enjoy later [graduating, passing the board exam, and having a
                    stable
                    job].”

                    Breaking through boundaries, her advice to those aspiring for academic success is, “Give 100% effort
                    in
                    everything you do.” She acknowledges that she may not be the best academically and must work harder
                    than
                    those who are naturally gifted, but she compensates for any weaknesses by dedicating herself fully
                    and
                    putting in her all.

                    “Ultimately, there are limitations as I cannot really study all the things that are demanded by my
                    program, so I lift it up to the Lord,” she expressed, emphasizing the value of faith at times when
                    she
                    is shrouded in doubt.

                    Yet with the high risk came a high reward, and the painstaking struggles she faced made her triumph
                    all
                    the more gratifying.

                    “It seemed impossible back then to stay in the program, but I am happy to have made it,” Lyle
                    gleefully
                    said.

                    Furthermore, she is elated to make her family, friends, college, former teachers, and fellow
                    students
                    proud. She admits; however, that her primary motivation was not to achieve accolades but to simply
                    work
                    hard to maintain good grades and stay in the program. The recognition, she says, is just a major
                    bonus.

                    As she steps outside the university’s walls, she views the future as looming with uncertainty but
                    she
                    remains hopeful on prevailing once again, now in the face of even higher expectations. Aiming to
                    make
                    her loved ones proud and carrying with her the knowledge gained from her colleagues, professors and
                    internship supervisors, she is set to embark once more into the path towards greatness.

                    Lyle’s journey, at its core, was one committed towards achieving a dream but ended up being more
                    than
                    what she had ever anticipated. What began as a grueling undertaking flourished into a testament of
                    infallible dedication. With the distinction under her belt, Lyle leaves a lasting legacy of being
                    cemented as a Summa Cum Laude graduate from USeP.</p>

            <h3>Ruth Melli Sayo</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    In a world that often speaks in low whispers, living as an individual with a hearing disability can
                    feel like being adrift in a vast sea, where every conversation is a distant wave and every
                    interaction is a challenge to connect and be understood. The classroom, usually a bustling center of
                    verbal dialogue and shared communication, becomes a maze of misjudged words and missed exchanges.

                    Yet, amid this profound quietness, Ruth Melli Sayo's journey shines like a torch in the night. Her
                    voice, though often unheard, echoes throughout our university’s halls and beyond, motivating others
                    to overcome their silences and let their voices be heard.

                    𝐖𝐞𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐃𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦

                    Ruth, a recent Bachelor of Special Needs and Education (BSNEd) graduate of the University of
                    Southeastern Philippines (USeP) Class of 2024, comes from a small town far removed from the bustling
                    city life of Davao. As the eldest and only deaf member of her family, Ruth's journey was filled with
                    unique challenges.

                    "I was an introvert," Ruth recalls, adding that, "In my hometown, there were no deaf students in
                    high school, so I moved to Davao City for my education."

                    Originally interested in teaching high school, Ruth discovered the BSNEd program through a friend
                    and found it to be the perfect fit.

                    "Special education related to me being deaf," she explained, accentuating the destined thread tied
                    between this bachelor's degree to her signing fingers.

                    𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐕𝐨𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐖𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧

                    Ruth’s pursuit towards higher education was driven by a desire to help the deaf community realize
                    their potential. However, every path is always fraught with obstacles.

                    "I faced many barriers," Ruth admits. "I didn't know how to communicate with hearing classmates, and
                    online classes were particularly challenging due to weak internet connections."

                    Despite these hurdles, Ruth persevered. She reached out to classmates and professors through
                    personal chats, seeking help and clarifications. Ruth understood that college life cannot be done
                    with her hands alone. Therefore, the face-to-face classes were a turning point for her!

                    "I started teaching my classmates sign language, and they helped me understand the discussions," she
                    reveals.

                    Being a deaf student at the university initially made Ruth feel isolated. However, her experience
                    and perseverance have become an inspiration for many.

                    "There’s an interpreter who knows sign language, and I’ve met many deaf friends who are now
                    considering enrolling in our university because they see how supportive and inclusive it is," she
                    says.

                    Ruth's journey has opened doors for future deaf and hard-of-hearing students, encouraging them to
                    pursue their education in an environment that welcomes and accommodates their needs.

                    𝐔𝐒𝐞𝐏-𝐎𝐛𝐫𝐞𝐫𝐨’𝐬 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐲

                    The university's commitment to inclusivity shone through in various ways. In the words of Ruth
                    herself, "BSNEd was incredibly accommodating."

                    "For instance, I had difficulty understanding lessons in Filipino, so they allowed me to transfer to
                    an English teacher and encouraged me to participate," she adds.

                    When faced with the same challenge in a subsequent semester, Ruth bravely communicated her needs to
                    the professor. The response was overwhelmingly supportive: handouts in English, detailed
                    instructions, and PowerPoint presentations were provided to ensure she could keep up with the
                    lessons.

                    "They explained things to me and gave more examples, which made a huge difference," she further
                    shares.

                    Ruth envisions a university where inclusivity is the norm, not the exception.

                    "I want hearing students to form close relationships with deaf students, promoting inclusiveness and
                    avoiding exclusion," she advocates.

                    She emphasizes that everyone has unique abilities and should be encouraged to pursue their dreams,
                    and suggests that new deaf students enrolling in various courses should be met with awareness and
                    support from their hearing peers.

                    "Hearing students should be aware of the needs of deaf students, not just those in BSNEd. Learning
                    sign language and being open to communication can make a big difference,” she expresses.

                    Ruth’s experience of becoming more independent without always relying on an interpreter is a
                    testament to the power of mutual understanding and support.

                    The university’s efforts to provide accommodations, such as interpreters and tailored educational
                    materials, have significantly contributed in creating an inclusive environment.

                    However, Ruth believes that there is always room for improvement, concluding that, "I suggest
                    continuous awareness programs and training for all students and faculty to understand and support
                    the needs of deaf students better.”

                    𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐕𝐨𝐢𝐜𝐞

                    "College was hard, but it changed my life," she reflects, signifying that Ruth’s journey in the
                    university has transformed her.

                    She adds that, "I discovered how to cope with my situation and made new friends. It was a great
                    experience."

                    With graduation behind her, Ruth has set her mind to amplify the voice from within. She is currently
                    preparing for the Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET) on September 2024 while being hopeful for
                    great experiences in the future.

                    The voice she has honed aims to reach other deaf students to inspire them in following their dreams
                    and pursue higher education.

                    “Do not be afraid. Do not focus only on the deaf community. Let everyone know about us so they can
                    communicate and include us. Together, we can change the narrative,” she urges her fellow community.

                    Truth be told, her journey illuminates the path for future deaf students, proving that with
                    determination and support, silence can indeed be broken, and dreams can soar. Her story is not just
                    one of a personal triumph but a beacon for building a more inclusive and supportive university
                    community for us all.

                    After all, Ruth is not just a graduate; she is a lighthouse amid the storm that looms over the
                    frightened minds of most, and a testament to the power of resilience. Indeed, her voice from within
                    shall echo through the halls of our university for generations to come, being a living testimony of
                    never backing down from breaking your silence and having your voice be heard.
