                        roommates. However, their amazing house was situated in a small resort town without any
                        meaningful venues, even public transportation, so it might as well have been in the middle of
                        nowhere.

                    <p>One of the biggest challenges when teaching is trying to motivate students. In addition,
                        covid-induced shifts to remote instruction (Fong, 2022) might have exacerbated students‚Äô already
                        declining motivations, even after beginning the ‚Äúnew normal.‚Äù</p>

                    <h3>Student Engagement</h3>
                    <p>With students learning in hybrid and virtual formats, optimizing engagement and increasing
                        motivation are more challenging than ever before. In any setting, involving students in their
                        own learning is key; we cannot expect them to be enthusiastic or motivated if they are merely
                        fed information and lectured to.

                        strategies, learning activities, and assessments. The way these are designed and aligned
                        influence student motivation, which in turn impacts student learning.</p>

                    <h3>What Teachers Can Do to Boost Student Motivation</h3>
                    <p>Studies show that giving students a role in deciding what their educational experience looks like
                        can help motivate them. This input may include having a say in their classroom environment,
                        being able to choose their homework assignment, or even being allowed to develop ideas for their
                        own assignments related to what is being studied in class.</p>
